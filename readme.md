# Todo List Azure API App Sample #

This is a simple example of how to build an [API App](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform/ "What are API Apps?") for deployment into the Azure App Service. This example API App uses a Web API back end and a simple HTML/AngularJS client to communicate with the API. 

## More Information ##
You can learn more about API Apps on the [Azure.com](http://azure.com "The Microsoft Azure Home Page") home page. This Todo List sample is similar to the [Contact List](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/API-Apps-DotNet-ContactList-Sample) API App Sample used throughout some of the articles outlining the process of creating, deploying, consuming, and debugging API Apps. Whereas the Contact List example goes further by providing a separate Web App that serves as a client to the API App back-end, this Todo List sample is self-contained, without a separate client Web App.
