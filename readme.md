# To Do List Azure API App Sample #

This is a simple example of how to build an [API App](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform/ "What are API Apps?") for deployment into the Azure App Service. This example API App uses a Web API middle tier, a Web API data tier, and an AngularJS client to communicate with the API. 

## More Information ##
You can learn more about API Apps on the [Azure.com](http://azure.com "The Microsoft Azure Home Page") home page. This To Do List sample is used in some of the articles that explain how to create, deploy, and consume API apps.
